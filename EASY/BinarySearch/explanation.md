# Explanation

### High level idea

First sort the array.  Then increment and decrement the pointers until they are equal to the targetSum.  

### Time and space complexity

Let: <br>

- `n` be the size of the input array<br>

Worst cases: <br>

- Time: `O(nlogn)` <br>
- Space: `O(1)`

### Edge cases missed
