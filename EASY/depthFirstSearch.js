// Depth First Search 

// Implement the depthFirstSearch method on the Node class, which takes in an empty array, traverses the tree using the Depth - first Search approach(specifically navigating the tree from left to right), stores all of the nodes' names in the input array, and returns it.  

// You are given a node class that has a name and an array of optional children nodes.

// When put together, nodes form a simple tree - like structure.
