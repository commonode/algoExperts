// Find Closest Value in BST 

// A node is said to be a BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST property: it's value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its value is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right; and both of its hildren nodes are either BST nodes themselves of None (null) values.  

// You are also given a target integer value; write a function that finds the closest value to that target value contained in the BST.  

// You are given a BST data structure consisting of BST nodes.

// Each BST node has an integer value stored in a property called "value" and two children nodes stored in properties called "left" and "right" respectively.

// There will only be one closest value.
