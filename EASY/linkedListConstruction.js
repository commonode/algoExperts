// Linked List Construction

// Write a class for a doubly linked list.

// The class should have a "head" and "tail" properties, both of which should point to either the None(null) value or to a Linked List node.

// Every node will have a "value" property as well as "next" and "prev" properties, both of which can either point to None(null) or another node.  

// The class should support setting the head and tail of the linked list, inserting nodes before and after other nodes as well as at certain positions, removing given nodes and removing nodes with specific values, and seareching for nodes with values.

// Only the searching method should return a value: specifically, a boolean
