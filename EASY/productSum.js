// Product Sum

// Write a function that takes in a "special" array and returns its product sum.  

// A "special" array is a non-empty array that contains either integers or other "special" arrays.  The product sum of a "special" array is the sum of its elements, where "special" arrays inside it shouldbe summed themselves and then multiplied by their level of depth.  

// For example, the product sum of [x,y] is x + y; the product sum of [x, [y,z]] is x + 2y + 2z.  

// O(n) time | O(d) space where n is the total number of elements in the array, including sub-elements and d is the greatest depth of "special" arrays in the array

function productSum(array, multiplier = 1) {
    let sum = 0;
    for (const element of array) {
        if (Array.isArray(element)) {
            sum += productSum(element, multiplier + 1);
        } else {
            sum += element;
        }
    }
    return sum * multiplier;
