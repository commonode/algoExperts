// Max Path Sum in Binary Tree

// Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns its max path sum.  A path is a collection of connected nodes where no node is connected to more than two other nodes; a path sum is the sum of the values of the nodes in a particular path.  Each binary tree node has a value stored in a property called "value" and two children nodes stored in properties called 'left' and 'right' respectively.  Children nodes can either be Binary Tree nodes themselves of the None(null) value.  

// O(n) time | O(log(n)) space
function maxPathSum(tree) {
    const[_, maxSum] = [...findMaxSum(tree)];
    return maxSum;
}

function findMaxSum(tree) {
    if (tree === null) return [0,0];

    const [leftMaxSumAsBranch, leftMaxPathSum] = findMaxSum(tree.left);
    const [rightMaxSumAsBranch, rightMaxPathSum] = findMaxSum(tree.right);
    const maxChildSumAsBranch = Math.max(leftMaxSumAsBranch, rightMaxSumAsBranch);

    const {value} = tree;
    const maxSumAsBranch = Math.max(maxChildSumAsBranch + value, value);
    const maxSumAsRootNode = Math.max(
        leftMaxSumAsBranch + value + rightMaxSumAsBranch,
        maxSumAsBranch,
    );
    const maxPathSum = Math.max(
        leftMaxPathSum,
        rightMaxPathSum,
        maxSumAsRootNode,
    );

    return [maxSumAsBranch, maxPathSum];
