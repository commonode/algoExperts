Find Loop

Write a function that takes in the head of a singly linked list that contains a loop (in other words, the list's tail node points to some node in the list instead of the None(null) value).  The function should return the node (the actual node - not just its vaule) from which the loop originates in constant space.  Note that every node in the Singly Linked List has a "value" property storing its value as well as a "next" property pointing to the next node in the list.
