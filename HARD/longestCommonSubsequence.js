Longest Common Subsequence

Implement a function that returns the longest subsequence common to two given SVGStringList.  A subsequence is defined as a gorup of characters that appear sequentially, with no importance given to their actual position in a string.  In other words, characters do not need to appear consecutively in order to form a subsequence.  Assume that there will only be one longest common subsequence.
