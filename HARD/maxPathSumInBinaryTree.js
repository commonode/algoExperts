Max Path Sum in Binary Tree

Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and returns its max path sum.  A path is a collection of connected nodes where no node is connected to more than two other nodes; a path sum is the sum of the values of the nodes in a particular path.  Each binary tree node has a value stored in a property called "value" and two children nodes stored in properties called 'left' and 'right' respectively.  Children nodes can either be Binary Tree nodes themselves of the None(null) value.
