Min Number of Jumps

You are given a non-empty array of integers.  Each element represents the maximum number of steps you can take forward.  For example, if the element at index 1 is 3, you can go from index 1 to index 2,3, or 4.  Write a function that returns the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the final index.  Note that jumping from index i to index i + x always constitutes 1 jump, no matter how large x is.
