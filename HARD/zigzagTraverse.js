Zigzag Traverse

Write a function that takes in a two dimensional array and returns a one-dimensional array of all the array's elements in zigzag order.  Zigzag starts at the top left corner of the two-dimensional array, goes down by one element, and proceeds in a zigzag pattern all the way to the bottom right corner.
