// Invert Binary Tree

// Write a function that takes in a Binary Tree and inverts it.In other words, the function should swap every left node in the tree for its corresponding(mirrored) right node.  

// Each Binary Tree node has a vaule stored in a property called value and two children nodes stored in properties called left and right, respectively.

// Children nodes can either be Binary Tree nodes themselves or the none value. 

// O(n) time | O(n) space

        const current = queue.shift();
        if (current === null) continue;
        swapLeftAndRight(current);
        queue.push(current.left);
        queue.push(current.right);
    }

    const left = tree.left;
