// Breadth First Search

// Given a node class that has a name and an array of optional children nodes.

// When put together, nodes form a simple tree - like structure.

// Implement the breadthFirstSearch method on the Node class, which takes in an empty array, traverses the tree using the Breadth - first search approach(specifically navigating the tree from left to right) stores all of the Nodes' names in the input array, and returns it.  

// The Breadth First Search algorithm works by traversing a graph level by level.

// In other words, before traversing any Node's children Nodes, its sibling nods must be traversed.  

// How can yuo simply and effectively keep track of Nodes' children Nodes as you traverse them, all the while retaining the order you must traverse them ?  

class Node {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.children = [];
    }

    addChild(name) {
        this.children.push(new Node(name));
        return this;
    }

    // O(v + e) time | O(v) space
    breadthFirstSearch(array) {
        const queue = [this];
        while (queue.length > 0) {
            const current = queue.shift();
            array.push(current.name);
            for (const child of current.children) {
                queue.push(child);
            }
        }
        return array;
    }
