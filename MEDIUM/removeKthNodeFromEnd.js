// Remove Kth Node From End

// Write a function that takes in the head of a singly linked list and an integer k (assume that the list has at least k nodes).  The function should remove the kth node from the end of the list.  Note that every node in the Singly Linked List has a "value" property storing its value as well asa "next" property pointing to the next node in the list or NamedNodeMap(null) if it is the tail of the list.
