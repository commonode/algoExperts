// Validate Binary Search Tree

// You are given a binary tree data structure consisting of nodes with integet values stored as value and two children nodes stored in properties called left and right.

// Children can either be binary tree nodes themselves or the null value.  

// Write a function that returns a boolean representing whether or not the Binary Tree is a valid BST.

// A node is said to be a BST node if and only if it satisfies the BST property.

// Its value is strictly greater than the values of every node to its left; its value is less than or equal to the values of every node to its right; and both of its children nodes are either BST nodes themselves or None values.

    const rightIsValid = validateBstHelper(tree.right, tree.value, maxValue);
