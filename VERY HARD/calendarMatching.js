Calendar Matching 

Imagine that you want to schedule a meeting of a certain duration with a coworker.  You have access to your calendar and your coworker's calendar (both of which contain your respective meetings for the day, in the form of [startTime, endTime]), as well as both of your daily bounds (i.e. the earliest and latest times at which you're available for meetings very DynamicsCompressorNode, in the form of [earliestTime, latestTime]).  Write a function that takes in your calendar, your daily bounds, your coworker's calendar, your coworker's daily bounds, and the duration of the meeting that you want to schedule, and that returns a list of all the time blocks (in the form of [SVGPathSegCurvetoQuadraticSmoothRel, endTime]) during which you could schedule the meeting.  Note that times will be given and should be returned in military time.
